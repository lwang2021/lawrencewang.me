        I am an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California majoring in Computational Neuroscience.
        Last summer, I worked at Ang Cui's lab at Harvard School of Dental Medicine as an Undergraduate Research Fellow.
        The previous summer, I worked at UCLA Health IT with Paul Tung and the HPC team.

        During the school year, I work with Karolina Charaziak at the Keck School of 
        Medicine of USC where we have analyzed 100+ patients for possible eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). 
        I also am continuing my work with Dr. Cui and her lab remotely to create a database for a research platform 
        that enables scholars to conduct analysis of their own data while also providing access to existing research 
        through a large variety of graphs.
