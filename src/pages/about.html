        I am an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California majoring in Computational Neuroscience. 
        Last summer, I worked at Dr. Ang Cui's lab at Harvard School of Dental Medicine as an Undergraduate Research
         Fellow. The previous summer, I worked at UCLA Health IT with Paul Tung and the HPC team.

        During the school year, I work with Dr. Karolina Charaziak at the Keck School of Medicine of USC where we have 
        analyzed 100+ patients for possible eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). I also am continuing my work with Ang 
        Cui and her lab remotely to create a database for a research platform that enables scholars to conduct analysis
        of their own data while also providing access to existing research through a large variety of graphs.

        I love learning more about the brain and the various functions that it plays in the body. But, more importantly, 
        I love integrating that information with coding where the data can be processed and analyzed. I find coding to 
        be a highly creative outlet to explore and interpret a specific scientific problem.

        Outside of school and work, I enjoy running and hanging out with friends. Some people say I play too many 
        video games, but I'll leave that up for debate.
