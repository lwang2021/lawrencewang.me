        Working with Dr. Ang Cui and her lab, I launched and refined the 
        <a href="http://immune-dictionary-dev.org/" style="color:white;">Immune Dictionary</a>. 
        The Immune Dictionary is a compilation of the gene expression of thousands of genes 
        after exposing specific cells to 86 distinct cytokines one by one. This data is then 
        analyzed and outputted into many graphs and tools for analysis.

        <br> <br>

        The website is built in R with Shiny and launched through ShinyProxy on a virtual 
        machine. The graphing is done through ggplot and Plotly so that graphs are more 
        organized and are available for download.

        Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is a difficult disorder to pinpoint and diagnose. 
        However, there are ways to narrow the possibility of the disorder. With Dr. Karolina 
        Charaziak, we work with 100+ elderly patients to determine whether or not they have 
        eustachian tube dysfunction through surveys and William's Test, which tests the 
        pressure of the ear itself.

        <br> <br>

        Since all of the data is on a different computer in the clinic which contains personal 
        data, it gets difficult to analyze the data. I created scripts to de-identify, extract, 
        and reupload the data onto RedCap. This data then gets analyzed to determine what is an 
        efficient method of diagnosing ETD.
